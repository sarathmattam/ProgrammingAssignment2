## Introduction

# The functions in cachematrix.R are intended to calculate the inverse of a matrix, cache the results and return result of inverse calculation from the cache during the next iterations if the matrix provided as input is the same. If a different matrix is provided, the inverse will be recalculated and the result will be cached

# Note : It is assumed that only valid matrices are provided as inputs to the function
